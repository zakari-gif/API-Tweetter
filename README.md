# API-Tweetter
This is an application written in python. It generates a visualization of the activity of our client's subscribers. By using Python to request the Twitter API, we collect data on users primarily (likes-tweets-retweets) to help predict the right time for the advertisement.
To run the program, you must download in your python console (pip install ...): pandas - tweepy - json. Once you run it, you enter the username of a Twitter account: EmmanuelMacron - elonmusk ...
There are so many problems:
+ Data retrieved limited due to Twitter restrictions.
+ Not functional for protected accounts.
